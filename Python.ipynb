        "1. What is Python, and why is it popular?\n",
        "   - Python is a high level languagw used in mostly the starting of the programer's journey known for it's versatility, readability and simplicity and tools used for web development, machine learning, automation, etc.\n",
        "       \n",
        "      **Python is popular because.**\n",
        "       1. **Beginner-Friendly**: Python is a very easy to learn and understand language so this makes it a good choice for the beginner's to start with.\n",
        "       2. **Wide use in industries**: Python is used across every tech industry.\n",
        "       3. **A lot of libraries**: Python is a languge having more than 137000 libraries which anyone can use from anywhere in the world.\n",
        "       4. **Versatility**: Python is used across many platforms like Web development, machine learning, Automation, software development, image processing, etc.\n",
        "       5. **Huge active community**: Python has a huge active community which maintains the smooth functioning of the libraries and work on updation of the libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is an interpreter in Python?\n",
        "  - In python a interpreter is a program that executes the python program directly. In interpreter the progeram is executed line ny line at the runtime. Hence it shows error if the error is in the any particular line.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python?\n",
        "  - Pre-defined keywords in Python are the reserved words with special meaning to the python. They are a part of the python syntax and cannot be used as identifiers like (variable names, function name, class name, object name, etc).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Can keywords be used as variable names?\n",
        "   - No, keywords cannot be used as variable names in python.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is mutability in Python?\n",
        "  - Mutability refers to the ability to change the state of the object after it has been created. It can be of two types\n",
        "    1. Mutable Objects: Objects whose content can be modified.\n",
        "      Example of mutable objects are: Lists, Dictionaries, sets, etc.\n",
        "    2. Immutable Objects: Objects whose content can't be modified.\n",
        "      Example of immutable objects are : Integers, floats, strings, tuples, etc.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?\n",
        " - Lists are mutable because they are designed to store data that can be changed, so their elements can be modified, added, or removed after the creation of lists.\n",
        "   \n",
        "      Whereas tuples are immutable because designed to represent fixed data, so after creating their elements cannot be changed or altered. The immutabolity makes tuple faster and memory efficient.\n",
        "    \n",
        "7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python?\n",
        " - Both \"==\" and \"is\" operator are used for comparison, but they have different purposes.\n",
        "    1. == (Equility operator): This operator compares the vlaues of two objects. It tells wheather the data of the two objects is same. If the value is same the operator returns True, otherwise it will return False.\n",
        "    <!-- Code -->\n",
        "    a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    print(a == b)\n",
        "\n",
        "    This will print True\n",
        "    \n",
        "    2. is (Identity operator): This operator compares the memory addresses of two objects. It returns True only if both variables point to the same object in memory.\n",
        "    <!-- Code -->\n",
        "    a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    b = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    print(a is b)\n",
        "    \n",
        "    This will print False because different objects in the memory even if the values are same.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    c = a\n",
        "\n",
        "    print (a is c)\n",
        "\n",
        "    This will print True because both refers to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What are logical operators in Python?\n",
        " - In python logical operators are used to combine the conditional statements and return a Boolean value. There are 3 logical operators.\n",
        "\n",
        "    1. **and operator (Logical AND)**\n",
        "     - It returns True if both the operands are true.\n",
        "     - Returns False if at least one operand is False.\n",
        "    2. **or operator (Logical OR)**\n",
        "    - It returns True if at least one operand is True.\n",
        "    - Returns False only if both operands are False.\n",
        "    3. **not operator (Logical NOT)**\n",
        "    - It returns the inverse value of the operand.\n",
        "    - If the operand is True, not will return False.\n",
        "    - If the operand is False, not will return True.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is type casting in Python?\n",
        "- Type casting in python is process of type conversion. It consists the process of converting a variable from one data type to another data type.\n",
        "\n",
        "  There are two main types of type casting in Python:\n",
        "  1. Implicit Type Casting: In this type casting, the python automatically converts one data type to another. it converts a smaller data type into a bigger data type to avoid data loss.\n",
        "  2. Explicit Type Casting: his involves manually converting a variable's data type using built-in functions provided by Python. Common functions include: int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), set().\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n",
        "-  The difference between implicit and explicit type casting is:\n",
        "    1. Implicit Type Casting: In this type casting, the python automatically converts one data type to another. it converts a smaller data type into a bigger data type to avoid data loss.\n",
        "    \n",
        "            Example : x = 5      # int\n",
        "              y = 2.5    # float\n",
        "              z = x + y  # int + float → float\n",
        "              print(z)   # 7.5\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Explicit Type Casting: his involves manually converting a variable's data type using built-in functions provided by Python. Common functions include: int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), set().\n",
        "\n",
        "            Example: a = \"100\"\n",
        "             b = int(a)      # string → int\n",
        "             c = float(a)    # string → float\n",

        "             print(c + 0.5)  # 100.5\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?\n",
        "- The purpose of conditional statements in Python is to control the flow of a program's execution based on specific conditions. They enable the program to make decisions and execute different blocks of code depending on whether a given condition evaluates to True or False.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. How does the elif statement work?\n",
        "- The elif (else if) statement in Python is used when you need to check multiple conditions after the initial if. It allows the program to test conditions one by one and execute the block of the first condition that is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "**How it works:**\n",
        "- The program checks the if condition first.\n",
        "- If if is false, it moves to the elif condition.\n",
        "- If an elif condition is true, its block runs, and the rest are skipped.\n",
        "- If none of the conditions are true, the else block (if present) runs.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. What is the difference between for and while loops?\n",
        "- Difference between for loop and while loop are:\n",
        "    1. **For Loop**\n",
        "    - Used when you know how many times you want to repeat.\n",
        "    - Iterates over a sequence (like list, string, range).\n",
        "    - Best for definite iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "     Example:  \n",
        "            for i in range(5):\n",
        "              print(i)   # Prints 0 to 4\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. \"\"While Loop**\n",
        "    - Used when you want to repeat until a condition is true.\n",
        "    - The number of iterations is not fixed in advance.\n",
        "    - Best for indefinite iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "      Example:   \n",
        "              i = 0\n",
        "              while i < 5:\n",
        "                print(i)\n",
        "                i += 1\n",
        "14. Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n",
        "- Suppose we are writing a program that keeps asking a user to enter a password, until they enter the correct one. Here, we cannot predict how many attempts the user will take, so a while loop is better."
